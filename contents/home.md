#### Biography
I am currently a graduate student at the School of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Southwest Jiaotong University, specializing in Computer Science and Technology. My research interests encompass databases, spatio-temporal data, data mining, and distributed systems, with a primary focus on the design and implementation of high-availability and high-performance data management tools based on spatio-temporal data, such as trajectory data. Since October 2022, I have been conducting relevant research under the guidance of Professor [Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng).

During my undergraduate studies at Southwest Jiaotong University, I also received various school-level honors, scholarships, and competition awards. Through the recommendation for graduate study, I continued my studies at the same university. Starting from March 2020, under the guidance of Professor [Huanlai Xing](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/xinghuanlai), I delved into research and study in the fields of time series classification, reinforcement learning, and semantic communication, a valuable experience that honed my research abilities and scientific intuition. I was also a member of the Southwest Jiaotong University competition team, participating in ICPC/CCPC competitions and achieving awards.

From December 2022 to October 2023, as an intern at [JD City Intelligence Research Institute(JD ICity)](https://icity.jd.com/), I joined the R&D team of [JUST (JD Urban Spatio-Temporal Data Engine)](https://just.jd.com/#/productCenter), dedicated to developing a more reliable and efficient trajectory data management tool, with the final results successfully published at the ICDE 2024 conference.

Subsequently, from January to March 2024, as an intern, I engaged in the database kernel work of the domestic time series database open-source project [CnosDB](https://cn.cnosdb.com/). This marked my first involvement in open-source project development, providing me with a profound appreciation for the allure of open-source projects.[[PR]](https://github.com/cnosdb/cnosdb/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aliikeuforever+is%3Aclosed+)
