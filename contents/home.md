#### Biography
I am currently a graduate student at the School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence, Southwest Jiaotong University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. My research area covers databases, spatio-temporal data, data mining and distributed systems, with a focus on the design and implementation of high availability and high performance data management tools based on spatio-temporal data (e.g., trajectory data). Since October 2022, I have been conducting related research under the guidance of my advisor, Prof. [Yu Zheng](http://urban-computing.com/yuzheng).

At the undergraduate level, I also studied in Southwest Jiaotong University, during which I won several university honors, scholarships and competition awards. Through the recommendation for graduate study, I continued my studies at the same university. Since March 2020, under the guidance of Prof. [Huanlai Xing](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/xinghuanlai), I have been focusing on research studies in the areas of temporal classification, reinforcement learning and semantic communication, which is an invaluable experience that has sharpened my research ability and research intuition. I am also a member of the varsity team of Southwest Jiaotong University's Programming Competition, and have participated in and won several ICPC/CCPC competitions.

Between December 2022 and October 2023, as an intern at the [JD ICity](https://icity.jd.com/), I joined the R&D team of [JUST (JD Urban Spatio-Temporal Data Engine)](https://just.jd.com/#/productCenter), working on a more usable and efficient trajectory data management tool, and the final results were successfully presented at the ICDE’2024.

Subsequently, from January to March 2024, as an intern, I participated in the database kernel work of [CnosDB](https://cn.cnosdb.com/), a domestic temporal database open source project, which was my first time to participate in the development of open source projects, and I deeply experienced the charm of open source projects.
